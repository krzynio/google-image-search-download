# Create a list of image urls from Google search results using Selenium

Useful for creation of a dataset for deep learning purposes. 

## Usage:

Fill a start_url in list.py and run it to receive a list of image urls.

## Warning:

It will fail when Google changes some class names on their image search results page. I don't know how often this could happen. I am sure that someone can wrote "autodiscovery" code for it and do a pull request.
